Hello
To run the SCRIPT and for it to work without errors, you need:
1. Have python 3.9 so that the script runs stably,
2. Install the instabot library in cmd, write pip install instabot,
3. I almost forgot, after each startup it is advisable to delete the file named config.
If you did everything correctly, you can launch the bat file.
